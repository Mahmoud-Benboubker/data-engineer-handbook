## Feedback on Submission

### 1. DDL for `actors` Table
- **Correct Implementation:** The DDL for the `actors` table is implemented correctly. The fields include an array of `struct` for `films`, quality classification enums, and a boolean for `is_active`. The usage of custom types for `film` and `quality_class` is a good design choice.

### 2. Cumulative Table Generation Query
- **Correct Implementation:** The query effectively aggregates data for actors from the `actor_films` table for the year 1971 and inserts it into the `actors` table. The conditional logic to determine `quality_class` is correct. The use of `ARRAY_AGG` to handle film arrays and joining with the previous year's data ensures the table is populated accurately.
- **Suggestion:** It might be beneficial to extend the query to easily change the year or operate on a range for scalability.

### 3. DDL for `actors_history_scd` Table
- **Correct Implementation:** The DDL correctly defines the `actors_history_scd` table and includes the necessary fields for implementing Type 2 dimension modeling. Including `start_date` and `end_date` fields follows best practices for slowly changing dimensions.

### 4. Backfill Query for `actors_history_scd`
- **Correct Implementation:** The backfill query logically identifies change points based on `quality_class` and `is_active`, then aggregates the data to populate the `actors_scd_table`. The use of window functions, such as `LAG` and `SUM` for change detection and streak identification, showcases a strong understanding of SQL capabilities for data transformation.
- **Optimization Advice:** Consider indexing the `actorid` column for potentially faster operations in a production setting when processing large datasets.

### 5. Incremental Query for `actors_history_scd`
- **Correct Implementation:** The query appropriately handles unchanged, changed, and new records, ensuring that the historical data and new entries are correctly merged. The logic for handling changes in `quality_class` and `is_active` states is correctly implemented.
- **Performance Suggestion:** Depending on the size of the data, consider analyzing performance, as left joins and multiple unions could impact processing times with larger datasets.

**Overall Assessment:** The submission demonstrates a thorough understanding of dimensional data modeling principles and SQL implementations for efficient dataset transformation and history tracking. The implementation and logic across all tasks are generally accurate and meet the assignment's requirements.
