** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for your submission. Let's go through each of your implemented prompts to provide detailed feedback:

1. **De-duplication Query (1_deduplicate_game_details.sql):**
   - Your query correctly removes duplicates based on `game_id`, `team_id`, and `player_id` using the `row_number` window function.
   - This approach is efficient, and you've ensured only the first occurrence of each duplicate set is preserved.
   - **Feedback**: Ensure all your columns in the `SELECT *` and within the `window` function are needed. This helps improve readability and performance if the table has many columns.

2. **User Devices Activity Datelist DDL (2_user_devices_cumulated.sql):**
   - The `user_devices_cumulated` table is correctly defined with `userid` and `device_activity_datelist` as a JSONB column, which allows for flexible storage of the mapped arrays.
   - **Feedback**: You might want to consider indexing the JSONB column or providing comments within the DDL to explain the choice of data types for better clarity.

3. **User Devices Activity Datelist Implementation (3_device_activity_datelist.sql):**
   - The implementation utilizes CTEs effectively to deduplicate events, join with device information, and aggregate dates per user and browser type.
   - You used `jsonb_agg` to construct the JSON object correctly, achieving a MAP-like outcome.
   - **Feedback**: Ensure that all intermediate CTEs are necessary; removing any unused or redundant steps can enhance query performance.

4. **User Devices Activity Int Datelist (4_datelist_int.sql):**
   - This query accurately transforms the `device_activity_datelist` into a `datelist_int`. Use of `STRING_AGG` and a cross join with a date generator for full coverage is well-done.
   - **Feedback**: Your logic is sound, but consider adding comments on why each step is necessary for someone who might not initially follow the transformation logic.

5. **Reduced Host Fact Array DDL and Implementation (7_host_activity_reduced.sql):**
   - The table schema for `host_activity_reduced` is correctly created. You've provided thorough logic in the incremental data population for a reduced fact table with `hit_array` and `unique_visitors_array`.
   - The UPSERT logic with conflict resolution is well-structured and maintains the integrity of historical data while allowing updates.
   - **Feedback**: While the usage of `COALESCE` is appropriate here, ensure you're handling large arrays properly to avoid potential performance bottlenecks. Also, a brief comment on why you chose to upsert would be beneficial for documentation.

In terms of areas that might need improvement, I see some slight misses in providing comments for clarity in some parts of your code, and ensuring performance considerations are factored in when dealing with complex JSON manipulations or possible large datasets.

Overall, you've shown a clear understanding of fact data modeling concepts and implemented functional and well-structured SQL statements.

**FINAL GRADE:**
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Great work!
